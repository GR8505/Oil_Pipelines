# Oil Pipelines Accidents Analysis
------------------------------
## [Data PreProcessing Steps](https://github.com/GR8505/Oil_Pipelines/blob/main/pipeline_analysis.ipynb)

1) Renaming of Features for simplicity
2) Using geopy to replace missing addresses
3) Replacing other missing values for other features with _zero_ or _Not Stated_ (where appropriate)
4) Feature Creation - Shutdown_Days (Gives the shutdown time for each oil pipeline facility in Days)

--------------------------------
## Further Preprocessing Steps

I realized that four locations were incorrect.
- Three in China and one off the Iberian coast

I did further investigations on these four addresses:
1) FROST, TX
2) MOBILE, AL
3) YODER, WY
4) LINDEN, NJ

Made the following [amendments](https://github.com/GR8505/Oil_Pipelines/blob/main/Further_Preprocessing.ipynb)
