# Oil Pipelines Accidents Analysis
------------------------------
## Data PreProcessing Steps

1) Renaming of Features for simplicity
2) Using geopy to replace missing addresses
3) Replacing other missing values for other features with _zero_ or _Not Stated_ (where appropriate)
4) Feature Creation - Shutdown_Days (Gives the shutdown time for each oil pipeline facility in Days)
